# CURRENCY CONVERTER

CurrencyFlex is a pet project that allows users to convert between four major currencies: Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and British Pound (GBP).

* Fetch live exchange rates using the ExchangeRate API.
* All currency conversion calculations are performed on the frontend to optimize API usage.
* Simple and user-friendly interface for quick conversions.
* Lightweight and easy to use with minimal features.

## Technologies:
